# Control And Device Guide

This page explains RoomMind's control settings and related device options.

## Dedicated And Shared Dehumidifiers

In a room's **Equipment -> Dehumidifier** section, select a native Home Assistant
dehumidifier (`humidifier.*`, device class `dehumidifier`) or a smart plug
(`switch.*`). A plug-controlled appliance must restart when power returns.
Each physical entity is registered once, in the room where it is located.

Select additional rooms to share the device. Each served room needs its own
humidity reading; only the host may use the native device's internal reading
when no external humidity sensor is configured. Overlapping groups are allowed:
a requesting room prefers its local device, then a running shared device.

Adding a device does not enable humidity comfort. Enable comfort separately in
each served room and select its target, tolerance and priority. Active comfort
profiles can override the target. Mold prevention uses the existing prevention
settings and prefers the dedicated device without changing the room's HVAC mode.

The host's window delays and quiet hours apply to the entire device. During
quiet hours comfort pauses; significant mold risk may still request operation.
Shared devices pause when the host reaches 45% humidity and resume from 50%.
Native device limits can raise this effective floor, which is shown in the panel.
Actual effectiveness between rooms depends on air circulation.

Minimum on/off times default to five minutes; the off delay also applies after
a restart. Missing required readings, windows and the host humidity floor can
stop a device immediately. Set nominal power if the electrical budget is enabled.
The dedicated device can operate alongside heating or cooling.

**Manual** mode leaves the physical state and setpoint untouched. Open the device
name for its normal Home Assistant controls. Automatic AC Dry is a fallback only
when all associated devices are physically unavailable; intentional pauses do not
trigger fallback. An "On" smart plug is not proof that its compressor is drying.

## What Priority Does

In `Settings -> Control -> Priority`, the slider balances comfort against runtime/energy use for MPC.

- Toward `Comfort`: RoomMind reacts earlier and works harder to stay close to the target temperature.
- Toward `Efficiency`: RoomMind allows more drift around the target to reduce heating/cooling runtime.

This setting does **not** change your schedule targets, overrides, comfort temperature, or eco temperature. It only changes how aggressively MPC tries to reach and hold those targets.

## Thermostat vs Climate Device

Both options are Home Assistant `climate.*` entities, but RoomMind treats them differently:

- `Thermostat`: a radiator thermostat / TRV style device.
- `Climate Device`: an AC, heat pump, or other climate entity used for cooling or forced-air heating.

In practice:

- Choose `Thermostat` for radiator valves and similar heating-only valve devices.
- Choose `Climate Device` for ACs, minisplits, heat pumps, and other self-contained HVAC units.

## Full Control vs Managed

An external room temperature sensor is the key split:

- `Full Control`: RoomMind uses the external sensor as the room truth and can actively shape device output.
- `Managed`: without an external room sensor, RoomMind sends target temperatures but the device mostly regulates itself using its own internal sensor.

This matters for the options below.

## Setpoint Mode: Proportional vs Direct

`Setpoint mode` is relevant for thermostat/TRV devices in `Full Control` rooms.

### Proportional

RoomMind calculates the required heating power, then sends a boosted device setpoint to achieve roughly that output.

Example:

- room target is `21°C`
- more heat is needed
- RoomMind may send `26-28°C` to the TRV to force the valve open harder

Best for:

- radiator valves / TRVs
- devices that need an exaggerated setpoint to actually deliver heat

### Direct

RoomMind sends the real target temperature and lets the device regulate itself.

Best for:

- space heaters
- pellet stoves
- devices with their own thermostat logic that should stay in control internally

## Idle Behavior: Off, Fan Only, Setback

`When idle` applies to `Climate Device` entries.

### Turn off

RoomMind turns the device off, or falls back to the device's minimum/off-like behavior if true off is not supported.

### Fan only

RoomMind keeps the device running in fan mode without active heating/cooling.

Useful when you want:

- air circulation
- less harsh on/off transitions

### Setback

RoomMind keeps the current HVAC mode active, but moves the target away from the room target:

- heating setback = `heat target - 2°C`
- cooling setback = `cool target + 2°C`

This lets the device back off instead of shutting off completely.

Important:

- the setback offset is currently fixed at `2°C`
- it is **not configurable** in the current UI

## Idle Behavior for Thermostats: Off, Low

`When idle` also applies to `Thermostat` / TRV entries, with different options.

### Turn off

RoomMind sends the TRV to its `off` state.

### Low

RoomMind keeps the TRV in its current heating mode but lowers the setpoint to the device's minimum temperature.

Useful for battery-powered Zigbee TRVs that enter deep sleep when set to `off` and then stop reacting to commands. `Low` keeps the valve responsive while effectively stopping heating.

## When "Turn off devices" Overrides `When idle`

`When idle` describes what a device should do while the room simply has no heating or cooling demand. It does **not** apply when you explicitly shut a room down via:

- `Settings → Control → Action when schedule is off` set to `Turn off devices`
- `Settings → Presence → Action when away` set to `Turn off devices`

In those cases RoomMind turns the devices off even if `When idle` is set to `Fan only` or `Setback`. Otherwise an AC would keep circulating air after the schedule ended.

The single exception is `Low` on thermostats: it stays active because the affected TRVs stop responding after being set to `off`. Lowering the setpoint to the device minimum already stops all heat output.

## Smart Source Selection

`Smart source selection` only appears when a room has:

- at least one `Thermostat` / TRV
- at least one `Climate Device` / AC
- an external temperature sensor

In that case RoomMind can decide which source should heat:

- TRV / boiler side
- AC / heat pump side
- or both, when the gap is large

It uses temperature gap and outdoor conditions to make that choice.
